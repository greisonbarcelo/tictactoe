Tic Tac Toe is a sleek, interactive game built for two players to battle it out in a grid of wits. It's all about:

- Watching the board update in real time.
- Seeing the game declare a winner—or a draw—with flair.
- Restarting instantly for a rematch.

No clutter. No distractions. Just pure, classic gameplay in a beautifully crafted digital space.
